The Inventory Management Application is a powerful solution designed to centralize and streamline large inventories. Deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), it adheres to a serverless architecture, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness. Leveraging key services such as AWS Lambda for business logic, Amazon RDS (MySQL) for data storage, Amazon API Gateway for secure API exposure, Amazon Cognito for user authentication, and Amazon S3 for static asset storage, the application efficiently manages inventory items. Infrastructure provisioning is handled seamlessly using Terraform. Additionally, an EC2 bastion host facilitates secure access to the RDS database
